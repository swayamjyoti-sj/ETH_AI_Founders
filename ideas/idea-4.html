    <h1>AI Research &amp; Insights Labs for SMBs</h1>
    <p class="hero-lead">
      A lightweight research lab for small and medium businesses: on-demand market intelligence,
      customer insights, and trend analysis powered by AI instead of a full in-house team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most SMBs never get around to proper research. They rely on gut feeling, scattered spreadsheets,
      and outdated reports. This idea turns AI into their 24/7 insights team.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Big companies pay consultants and research firms to monitor markets, customers, and competitors.
          SMBs usually can’t:
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>No budget for dedicated research staff or agencies.</li>
          <li>Data is fragmented across tools: CRM, website, socials, reviews, support inbox.</li>
          <li>Decisions are made on intuition instead of live data and structured analysis.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          An “AI Research &amp; Insights Lab” subscription that plugs into the SMB’s existing tools and
          delivers clear answers instead of raw dashboards:
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Continuous monitoring of reviews, social media, and competitors’ pages.</li>
          <li>Monthly or weekly “Insight Packs” in plain language: what changed, what to worry about, what to try.</li>
          <li>Customer segmentation and churn-risk signals surfaced automatically.</li>
          <li>One-click deep dives: “Why are we losing leads from channel X?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The AI does the heavy lifting; humans (you) curate, sanity-check and highlight the real actions.

        <h2>Why Us</h2>
        <p>
          With backgrounds across ETH Zurich, RWTH Aachen, Brown, IIT and real-world SaaS (e.g. ElectriStay),
          we’re used to turning messy data into decisions. This lab formalizes that capability for SMBs that
          can’t build a full analytics team.
