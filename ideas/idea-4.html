    <h1>AI Research &amp; Insights Labs for SMBs</h1>
    <p class="hero-lead">
      A “fractional research lab” for small and medium businesses: on-demand market intelligence,
      customer insights, and competitor analysis powered by AI, curated by humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of guessing or buying expensive consulting reports, SMBs get a lightweight lab that
      constantly watches their market and turns messy data into clear recommendations.

      <!-- Problem -->
      <article class="card">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Serious market research is a luxury. Large companies hire analysts and agencies;
          SMBs run on intuition, scattered spreadsheets, and outdated reports:
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>No budget for a dedicated research / strategy team.</li>
          <li>Customer feedback is fragmented across email, CRM, reviews, and support tickets.</li>
          <li>Competitive and market changes are spotted late, if at all.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Decisions about pricing, positioning, and product roadmap are often made in the dark.
        </p>

      <!-- Solution -->

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          An “AI Research &amp; Insights Lab” subscription that plugs into the tools SMBs already use
          and delivers plain-language insight packs instead of raw dashboards:
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Ingests data from CRM, website analytics, reviews, social media, and support tickets.</li>
          <li>Clusters feedback into themes: feature requests, churn reasons, objections, compliments.</li>
          <li>Monitors competitors’ websites, pricing pages, and public releases.</li>
          <li>Delivers weekly or monthly briefings: “What changed, why it matters, what to do next.”</li>
          <li>Allows ad-hoc questions: “Are trial users from channel X lower quality than Y?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          AI handles collection and first-pass analysis; humans review and highlight the actions.

      <!-- Example Use Cases -->
      <article class="card">
        <h2>Example Use Cases</h2>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>A boutique SaaS sees which features drive upgrades versus churn and adjusts roadmap.</li>
          <li>An EV-friendly hotel chain understands why guests choose them over competitors.</li>
          <li>An e-commerce brand catches a new competitor undercutting them in a key region.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <!-- Why Us -->
      <article class="card">
        <h2>Why Us</h2>
        <p>
          Our backgrounds across ETH Zurich, RWTH Aachen, Brown, IIT and SaaS (e.g. ElectriStay)
          sit at the intersection of deep technical work and real-world operations. We’re used to
          taking noisy data—experiments, user feedback, system logs—and turning it into decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This idea packages that capability into a repeatable lab offering for SMBs who can’t
          afford a full strategy or data team.
