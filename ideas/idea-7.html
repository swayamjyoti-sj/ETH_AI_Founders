    <h1>AI Lab-to-Market Scout</h1>
    <p class="hero-lead">
      An AI scout that scans scientific papers, theses, patents, and internal reports to
      surface commercializable ideas, potential products, and startup concepts for universities
      and R&amp;D-heavy companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of great research dying in PDFs and internal drives, teams get a prioritized list
      of “this could be a product” opportunities with suggested markets and next steps.

      <!-- Problem -->
      <article class="card">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Universities and R&amp;D labs are full of IP and prototypes that never leave the lab:
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Tech transfer offices are understaffed and can’t deeply read every paper or thesis.</li>
          <li>Researchers are rewarded for publications, not for commercialization.</li>
          <li>Industry partners don’t know what’s being developed until it’s too late or too early.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a result, billions in potential value remains “hidden” in PDFs, lab notebooks, and internal slides.
        </p>

      <!-- Solution -->

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          An AI “Lab-to-Market Scout” that continuously ingests research outputs and flags
          high-potential commercialization candidates:
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Reads papers, theses, patents, proposals, and project reports.</li>
          <li>Classifies work by technology area, maturity, and potential applications.</li>
          <li>Maps each item to possible markets, use-cases, and existing companies.</li>
          <li>Scores opportunities on impact, readiness, and differentiation.</li>
          <li>Produces concise opportunity briefs for tech transfer, founders, and investors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Human experts review the top-ranked candidates and decide what to pursue.

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Example Workflow</h2>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Connect institutional repositories, preprint servers, and patent databases.</li>
          <li>AI ingests new material weekly and updates an opportunity pipeline.</li>
          <li>Tech transfer staff receive a shortlist: “Top 10 commercialization candidates this quarter.”</li>
          <li>Each candidate has: a one-page brief, potential markets, competitor overview, and risks.</li>
          <li>Selected projects move into deeper diligence or spin-out support.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Why Us -->
      <article class="card">
        <h2>Why Us</h2>
        <p>
          With roots at ETH Zurich, RWTH Aachen, Brown, and IIT, we live in environments where
          high-value research often stops at publication. We also have direct experience with
          industry collaboration and scientific productization.
        </p>
        <p>
          This product is a natural bridge between our academic background and our startup ambitions:
          systematically surfacing “hidden” opportunities and helping push them toward the market.
